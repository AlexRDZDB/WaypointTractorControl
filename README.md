# Waypoint Tractor Control
This was a project developed for my Advanced Embedded Systems Class. This project incorporates sensor data by connecting to a Wireless Camera via an NRF antenna and obtaining simulated GPS coordinates. It uses a state machine to follow a predetermined path determined by waypoints. Video evidence found in FINAL_TEST.mp4
